Understood the files in script folder produced by Dr. Furuta, 01 is to separate 
the pep file into 10000 each, because the web version of TMHMM 2.0 tool has a limit.
file 02 to 04 are files that export the result form signalp, TMHMM and pfam, in the 
end 05 combine and export the result into an excel file. 
- build a directory R-script for R script
- copy 01_separateFASTA.R into separate-pep.R
- readAAStringSet, AA stands for amino acid
- seq_along() creates a vector that contains a sequence of numbers from 1 
to the objectâ€™s length.
- build a directory separate-pep for out put result of separate-pep.R 
- generated batch_1:7.pep files

**The TMHMM-2.0 is outdated.** Deep TMHMM is used instead. This version
allows for more than 10000 per run. will use all.pep file.
- used anaconda to install pybiolib, it did not work out
- used pip install command from the website
- the command installed successfully, though biolib function cannot run

**Cannot get the terminal version working,** will use the website to run
- batch1 took too long on the website and it aborted after 1.5 hr
- batch7 finished, I compared the result from Dr. Furuta's, they are 
not completely the same

**tried using ubuntu on windows** and it worked.
